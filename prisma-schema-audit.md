# Prisma Schema Audit Report

## Overview
Checking for schema inconsistencies, missing indexes, and optimization opportunities.

## Checks to Perform:

### 1. Schema Validation
Run this command to validate the Prisma schema:
```bash
cd /Users/stefantudosescu/birghtnest && npx prisma validate
```

### 2. Schema Format Check
Run this to ensure proper formatting:
```bash
cd /Users/stefantudosescu/birghtnest && npx prisma format
```

### 3. Database Schema Sync Check
Check if Prisma schema matches the actual database:
```bash
cd /Users/stefantudosescu/birghtnest && npx prisma db pull --force
```
This will show any drift between your Prisma schema and actual database.

### 4. Generate Migration Status
Check for any pending migrations:
```bash
cd /Users/stefantudosescu/birghtnest && npx prisma migrate status
```

### 5. Check for Unused Models
Look for models in schema that have no references in the codebase.

### 6. Index Analysis
- Check if foreign keys have indexes
- Verify indexes on commonly queried fields
- Look for over-indexing

### 7. Relation Integrity
- Verify all relations have proper @relation attributes
- Check for cascading deletes that might be dangerous
- Verify referential actions (onDelete, onUpdate)

## Potential Issues Found (Manual Review Needed):

### Missing Email Field in QuizSession
- QuizSession model doesn't have an `email` field but the audit SQL references it
- Need to check if this field exists in the database

### Task Model Relation
- Tasks reference appointments but may not have proper cascade deletes
- Should verify if orphaned tasks exist

### Note Model
- Notes use `leadEmail` for lookup but there's no foreign key relation
- This could lead to orphaned notes

### Affiliate Models
- Multiple counter fields (totalClicks, totalLeads, etc.) that need to stay in sync
- Consider using database views or computed fields instead

## Recommendations:

1. **Add Missing Indexes** for frequently queried fields
2. **Consider Soft Deletes** for critical data (affiliates, appointments)
3. **Add Database Constraints** for data integrity
4. **Use Database Views** for computed statistics instead of stored counters
5. **Add Unique Constraints** where appropriate
6. **Review Cascade Deletes** to prevent accidental data loss
